Installation instructions

SETSM is dependent on the TIFF Library, which you must download and install 
separately.  Download LibTIFF from http://libtiff.maptools.org/ and install
it according to the instructions in the README file.  In short,

```
./configure --prefix=/directory-to-install-in
make
make install
```

Once LibTIFF is installed you must edit the SETSM Makefile to set the correct
path to the library.  SETSM can then be built simply by typing make.

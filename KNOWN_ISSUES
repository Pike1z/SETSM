Known issues with the current SETSM release:

Issue:  Compiler vectorization bug -- It appears that the Intel 16, 17 and 18 
compilers and GCC prior to v. 9 have a bug related to vectorization for 
AVX instruction sets.

Symptom:  SETSM results may not be repeatable for identical runs.

Recommended solution:  Use Intel 19.0.3 or GCC 9.1 or newer version.

Alternative workaround:  For Intel, replace the -xHost option with -xSSE3.  
For GCC, remove -march=native.
